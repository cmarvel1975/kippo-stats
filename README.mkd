kippo stats
===========

A [Mojolicious][1] and [DBIx::Class][2] webapp to display statistics about your [kippo][3] SSH honeypot.

Prerequisites
-------------

    cpanm Mojolicious DBIx::Class Date::Calc Chart::Strip Date::Parse

Configuration
-------------

Kippo's `kippo.cfg` needs configured as per the comments on their [FAQ][4] and a database created, rights granted to the user, yadda yadda yadda

    [database_mysql]
    host = localhost
    database = kippo
    username = kippo
    password = AV3ryStr0ngP455w0rdunl1k3th150n3

The user above needs to be able to have all rights on `kippo.*` so that the program can write logs to the database.

For this Mojolicious application, I would suggest creating a separate `kippostats` user, which instead only needs `SELECT` rights on `kippo.*` to display the statistics.

You need to configure `kippo_stats.json` accordingly, specifying the `dsn`, `username` and `password`.

You can then launch a development server on `localhost:3000` by issuing:

    perl script/kippo_stats daemon

The statistics will be available at `http://localhost:3000/stats/`. Additional statistics are linked from that "landing" page.

If you'd like to make the development server available via lighttpd, you may want to use the following stanza:

    $HTTP["host"] =~ "kippostats\.example\.com" {
        url.redirect         = ( "^/$" => "http://kippostats.example.com/stats/" )
        server.errorlog      = "/var/log/lighttpd/kippostats-error.log"
        accesslog.filename   = "/var/log/lighttpd/kippostats-access.log"
        server.document-root = "/home/yourusername/kippo_stats/public"
        proxy.server         = ( "" => (("host" => "127.0.0.1","port" => "3000")) )
    }

The above Works For MeÂ®; your mileage will vary, and fuel costs will rise.

Statistics
----------

The "landing" page at `/stats/` shows the statistics for today only, grouped on 10 minutes intervals.
You can click on one of the graphs to display statistics for that "metric" for today, last 7 and last 30 days.

The following "metrics" are implemented:

- number of attempted SSH sessions every X minutes (10 minutes for today, 30 minutes for the week and 1 hour for the month)
- number of successful SSH connections every X minutes (same 10, 30, 1 hour)

Which statistics are displayed and for which intervals are conveniently "configurable" via JavaScript on the respective statistics' HTML pages (they're URL parameters).

I will add other stats such as most common password tried, number of attempts per username, etc. Suggestions are welcome.

Here's how the homepage looks like:
